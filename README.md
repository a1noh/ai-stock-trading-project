# 📈 AI Stock Trading Agent on AWS 🚀

## 🧑‍💻 Overview
The goal of this project is to create an AI agent that can buy and sell stocks based on real-time market data. The architecture uses AWS services to fetch stock data, preprocess it, train an AI model, make predictions, and execute trades. The AI agent leverages **reinforcement learning** to optimize decision-making for maximum returns.

## 🔧 Architecture Components

### 1. **Data Collection** 📊
- **Stock Market API (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.)**:
  - Fetches real-time stock market data, including stock prices, volume, technical indicators, and news.
  - Data is fetched at a specified frequency (e.g., every minute).
  
- **AWS Lambda** 🐑:
  - Fetches data from the stock market API at regular intervals using **EventBridge**.
  - Lambda handles the extraction process.

- **Amazon EventBridge** ⏰:
  - Schedules Lambda executions to fetch stock data at regular intervals (e.g., every minute).

---

### 2. **Data Storage** 💾
- **Amazon S3 (Raw Storage)**:
  - Stores raw stock market data in formats like JSON or CSV.
  - Example path: `s3://my-stock-data/raw/`
  
- **Amazon S3 (Processed Storage)**:
  - Stores processed data after cleaning and feature engineering.
  - Example path: `s3://my-stock-data/processed/`

---

### 3. **Data Preprocessing** 🔄
- **AWS Glue**:
  - Performs **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks:
    - Extracts raw stock data from S3.
    - Transforms data by handling missing values, normalizing values, and generating new features (e.g., moving averages, RSI).
    - Loads the processed data back into S3 in a clean format.

---

### 4. **Model Training and Prediction** 🤖
- **Amazon SageMaker**:
  - Used for training the AI agent model using **reinforcement learning (RL)** techniques.
  - The agent learns to optimize its trading strategy by interacting with stock market data.
  - SageMaker handles both the training of the model and inference (making buy/sell predictions).

---

### 5. **Decision-Making** 💡
- The trained model uses the latest stock data to make buy or sell decisions based on market trends and historical patterns.

- **API Gateway** 🌐:
  - Acts as an interface to send the buy/sell decisions to an external broker or exchange for execution.
  - The decisions are converted into trades through the API calls.

---

### 6. **Real-Time Data Streaming (Optional)** 📡
- **Amazon Kinesis**:
  - Streams live stock data to enhance the decision-making process in real time.
  - The AI agent uses this data to adjust its strategy based on current market conditions.

---

### 7. **Monitoring and Alerts** 🛠️
- **Amazon CloudWatch**:
  - Monitors Lambda executions, data processing jobs, and system health.
  - Logs system performance, errors, and provides insights into the AI model's decisions.

- **Amazon SNS** 📢:
  - Sends notifications or alerts if there are any issues with the data processing pipeline, Lambda functions, or API executions.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Stock market data is fetched by AWS Lambda every minute, triggered by Amazon EventBridge.
   - The data is stored in S3 in raw format.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - AWS Glue extracts raw stock data from S3, performs transformations like cleaning and feature generation, and loads the processed data back into S3.
   
3. **Model Training**:
   - Amazon SageMaker uses the processed data to train a reinforcement learning model. The model learns optimal strategies for buying and selling stocks based on past data and market conditions.
   
4. **Prediction**:
   - After training, the model uses real-time stock data to make buy/sell decisions. Predictions are sent to API Gateway.
   
5. **Trade Execution**:
   - API Gateway interacts with external trading systems or broker APIs to execute buy and sell orders.
   
6. **Monitoring**:
   - Amazon CloudWatch monitors the Lambda functions, Glue jobs, and SageMaker model.
   - Notifications about errors or issues are sent through SNS.
